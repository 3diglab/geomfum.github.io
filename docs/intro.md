# Welcome to GeomFuM

![GeomFuM logo](../static/img/GeomFuMlogo.png)

**GeomFuM** is a modular Python package for Machine Learning with [Functional Maps](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2185520.2185526).

Our mission is to **democratize the use and research** on functional approaches to handle geometric data.

We provide tools for:

- 🧠 Functional maps as a core abstraction
- 🧩 Geometry processing made ML-friendly
- 🔧 Modular and extensible design
- 🌍 Open and accessible tools for everyone

Explore the tutorials, try examples, and join the growing community!
